(a)	âConstituent Assemblyâ means the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh; and
(b)	âPolitical Partyâ includes a group or combination of persons who operate within or outside the Constituent Assembly under a distinctive name or hold themselves out as a group distinct from other groups for the purpose of propagating any political opinion or engaging in any other political activity.
(ii) 	is expelled by such political party; he shall cease to be a member of the Constituent Assembly for the unexpired period of his term as such member.
