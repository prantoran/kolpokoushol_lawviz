(3) The Commission shall, after making such enquiries and examining such records as it may deem necessary, publish in the official Gazette a preliminary list of territorial constituencies specifying the areas proposed to be included in each such constituency together with a notice inviting objections and suggestions within such period as may be specified in the notice.
