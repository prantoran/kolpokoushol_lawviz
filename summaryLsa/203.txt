WHEREAS an emergency has arisen which makes it necessary to provide for the trial and punishment of enemy agents and persons committing certain offences with intent to aid the enemy;
(b)	âenemy agentâ means a person, not operating as a member of an enemy armed force, who is employed by, or works for, or acts on instructions received from, the enemy.
(b)	though no person is so sentenced, the Special Judge certifies that in his opinion the case has involved questions of special difficulty, whether of law or fact, or is one which for any other reason ought properly to be reviewed,
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Evidence Act, 1872, when the statement of any person has been recorded by any Magistrate, such statement may be admitted in evidence in any trial before a Special Judge, if such person is dead or cannot be found or is incapable of giving evidence.
(1) When any accused in a trial before a Special Judge has by his voluntary act rendered himself incapable of appearing before the Court, or resists his production before it, or behaves before it in a persistently disorderly manner, the Court may, at any stage of the trial, by order in writing, made after such inquiry as it may think fit, dispense with the attendance of such accused for such period as it may think fit and proceed with the trial in his absence.
(2) Where a plea is required in answer to a charge from an accused whose attendance has been dispensed with under sub-section (1), such accused shall be deemed not to plead guilty.
