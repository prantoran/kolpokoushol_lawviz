WHEREAS an emergency has arisen which makes it necessary to requisition immoveable property within the limits of Cantonments for purposes other than of the Cantonment Boards.
(1) If in the opinion of the Government it is necessary or expedient so to do, the Government may by order in writing requisition any immoveable property (excluding the places of religious worship) and may make such further orders as appear to it to be necessary or expedient in connection with requisitioning.
(1) Where any property requisitioned under section 2 is to be released from requisition, the Government may after making such inquiry, if any, as it considers necessary, specify by order in writing, the person to whom possession of the property shall be given.
(c) 	The compensation fixed the Government under clause (b) above shall be final and no suit or appeal shall lie against Government before any court of law in that behalf.
The Government may take or cause to be taken such steps and use or caused to be used such force as may in the opinion of that Government be reasonably necessary for securing compliance with any order made by it under this Ordinance.
The Government may by order notified in the official Gazette, direct that any power conferred or any duty imposed on it by this Ordinance shall in such circumstances and under such conditions, if any, as may be specified in the direction be exercised or discharged by such officer as may be so specified.
