(a) 	on the day of which such race is to be run,

Finding cards, etc, in suspected houses to be evidence that they are common gaming-houses
On conviction of any person for keeping or using any such common gaming-house, or being present therein for the purpose of gaming, the convicting Magistrate may order all the instruments of gaming found therein to be destroyed, and may also order all or any of the securities for money, and other articles seized, not being instruments of gaming to be sold and converted into money, and the proceeds thereof with all moneys seized therein to be forfeited; or in his discretion, may order any part thereof to be returned to the persons appearing to have been severally thereunto entitled.
Such person, when apprehended, shall be brought without delay before a Magistrate, and shall be liable to a fine not exceeding fifty taka, or to imprisonment, either simple or rigorous, for any term not exceeding one calendar month,
Nothing in this Act shall apply to any game of mere skill, wherever played.]
