WHEREAS it is expedient to enable the Government to impose with immediate effect protective duties of customs on goods produced or manufactured outside Bangladesh and imported into Bangladesh where such imposition is urgently necessary in the interest of industries established in Bangladesh;
(3) It shall come into force at once.
(a) 	impose on any goods produced or manufactured in any country outside Bangladesh and imported into Bangladesh a duty of customs of such amount and for such period as it thinks fit; or
Customs Act, 1969], and shall be in addition to any duties imposed under that Act or any other law for the time being in force.
(1) If, after such enquiry as it thinks necessary the Government is satisfied that the duty imposed on any goods under sub-section (1) of section 2 (altered, where necessary, in the manner hereinafter provided) has become unnecessary or excessive or that it is too low to provide adequate protection to the industry concerned in Bangladesh, it may, by notification in the official Gazette, reduce or raise the duty to such extent and for such period (which may be extended from time to time but by not more than three years at any one time) as it thinks fit.
(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power such rules may prescribe the conditions subject to which any goods shall be deemed to be produced or manufactured in a particular country for the purposes of this Act.
