An Act to provide for the promotion and protection of foreign private investment in Bangladesh.
WHEREAS it is expedient to provide for the promotion and protection of foreign private investment in Bangladesh;
(a)	 âforeign capitalâ means capital invested in Bangladesh in any industrial undertaking by a citizen of any foreign country or by a company incorporated outside Bangladesh, in the form of foreign exchange, imported machinery and equipment, or in such other form as the Government may approve for the purpose of such investment;
(2) Sanction of the establishment with foreign capital of an industrial undertaking under sub-section (1) may be subject to such conditions as the Government may deem fit to impose.
The terms of sanction, permission or licence granted by Government to an industrial undertaking having foreign private investment shall not be unilaterally changed so as to adversely alter the conditions under which the establishment of such undertaking was sanctioned; nor shall foreign private investment be accorded a less favourable treatment than what is accorded to similar private investment by the citizens of Bangladesh in the application of relevant rules and regulations.
In the event of losses of foreign investment owing to civil commotion, insurrection, or riot, foreign private investment shall be accorded the same treatment with regard to indemnification, compensation, restitution, or other settlement as is accorded to investments by the citizens of Bangladesh.
