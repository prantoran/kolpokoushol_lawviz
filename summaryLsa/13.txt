Every carriage drawn by one or more horses which shall ordinarily be used for the purpose of conveying passengers for hire to or from any place in Bangladesh shall, without regard to the form or construction of such carriage, be deemed to be a stage-carriage within the meaning of this Act.
Whoever lets for hire any stage-carriage without the same being licensed as provided by this Act, shall be liable, on a first conviction, to a fine not exceeding one hundred taka, and on any subsequent conviction, to a fine which may extend to five hundred taka.
In every case where such stage-carriage shall be proved to have been drawn by a less number of horses, or to have carried a larger number of passengers or a greater weight of luggage, than shall be provided by the license, the proprietor of such carriage shall be held to have knowingly permitted such offence, unless he shall prove that the offence was not committed with his connivance, and that he had taken every reasonable precaution and had made reasonable provision to prevent the commission of the offence.
Whenever the driver of any stage-carriage of the owner of any horse employed in drawing any stage-carriage shall have committed any offence against this Act for the commission where of any penalty is by this Act imposed, other than an offence specified in section 8, and such driver or owner shall not be known, or being known can not be found, or if the penalty cannot be recovered from such driver or owner, the proprietor of such carriage shall be liable to every such penalty as if he had been the driver of such carriage or owner of such horse at the time when such offence was committed:
All penalties incurred under this Act shall be adjudged by a Magistrate as aforesaid, and all orders made under this Act by such Magistrate shall be final.
On complaint made before any Magistrate of any offence committed under this Act, it shall not be necessary to prove that the offence was committed within the local limits of such Magistrate or other officer.
