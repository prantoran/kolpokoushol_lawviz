For regulating Inquiries into the behaviour of Public Servants.
When the charge shall be brought by an accuser, the Government shall require the accusation to be reduced to writing, and verified by the oath or solemn affirmation of the accuser; and every person who shall wilfully and maliciously make any false accusation under this Act, upon such oath or affirmation, shall be liable to the penalties of perjury, but this enactment shall not be construed to prevent the Government from instituting any enquiry which it shall think fit, without such accusation on oath or solemn affirmation as aforesaid.
The prosecutor shall be entitled to re-examine the witnesses on any points on which they have been cross examined, but not on any new matter, without leave of the commissioners, who also may put such question as they think fit.
When such application is made and refused, the commissioners shall record the application, and their reasons for refusing to comply with it.
Power to call for further evidence or explanation Inquiry into additional articles of charge
Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the authority of Government, for suspending or removing any public servant for any cause without an inquiry under this Act.
