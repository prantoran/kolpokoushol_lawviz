For avoiding loss by the default of Public Accountants.
In default of any Act having special reference to the office of any public accountant, the security given shall be of such amount and kind, real or personal, or both, and with such sureties (regard being had to the nature of the office), as shall be required by any rules made or to be made from time to time, by the authority by which each public accountant is appointed to his office.
For the purposes of sections 1 and 2 of this Act, the expression âpublic accountantâ means any person who as Official Assignee or Trustee, or as sarbarahkar, is entrusted with the receipt, custody or control of any moneys or securities for money, or the management of any lands belonging to any other person or persons; and for the purposes of sections 4 and 5 of this Act the expression shall also include any person who, by reason of any office held by him in the service of the State is entrusted with the receipt, custody or control of any moneys or securities for money, or the management of any lands belonging to the Government.
The person or persons at the head of the office to which any public accountant belongs may proceed against any such public accountant and his securities for any loss or defalcation in his accounts, as if the amount thereof were an arrear of land-revenue due to Government.
